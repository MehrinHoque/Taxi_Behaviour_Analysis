# Taxi_Behaviour_Visualisation
The project studies the findings from urban mobility simulations from vehicles involved in public transport in the  city of Rome, Italy and provides useful knowledge for identifying and solving problems in a city's road system. 

R programming is used to 
    clean the data,
    visualise and plot the data on a ggplot,
    conduct statistical analysis.
